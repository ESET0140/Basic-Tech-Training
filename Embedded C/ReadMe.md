In this code i have followed the comment provided by the instructor and run a loop for led blinking which includes ON and OFF for 200 ms.
The threshold was set to 3 and if it increases the threshold the delay is increased to 300 ms.
In total led blinks 5 times. for three times it has delay of 200 ms and 300ms for other 2 times.
